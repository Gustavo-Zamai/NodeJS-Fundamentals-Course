# ⚽ Programming Challenge: Virtual Soccer Substitution

## Challenge

Create a program that simulates a soccer match between two virtual teams. The program should ask the user to input the names of five players, storing each one in an element of an array. Then, the program should ask the user which player they want to substitute. The user must enter the index (position) of the player they want to replace and then enter the name of the new player. The program must replace the selected player with the new one.
