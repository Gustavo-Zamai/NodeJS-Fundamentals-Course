# Game Catalog Challenge

## Description

In this challenge, the objective is to create a **game catalog** that allows the user to add a specific number of games.  

Start by asking the user how many games they want to add. Then, prompt for the name of each game individually, storing them in an array called `gameNames`.  

Use a `for` loop to simplify the process of adding the games.  

Once completed, display a **summary in a single line** that indicates the **total number of games added** and the list of game names in the catalog.

## Input

The program begins by asking the user to input the number of games they want to add to the catalog.  

Then, for each game, the user is prompted to enter the gameâ€™s name.

## Output

After all games have been added, the program displays a summary including:
- the total number of games added, and
- the list of game names separated by commas.  

This summary provides a clear overview of the games included in the catalog.
