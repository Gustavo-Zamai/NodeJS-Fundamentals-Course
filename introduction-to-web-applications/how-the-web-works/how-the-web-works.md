# 🌐 FUNDAMENTALS OF WEB APPLICATIONS

## 🈸 1. Application Domain

- **Localhost**: Local development environment.  
- **Back-end**: Server where data is processed and stored.  
- **Front-end**: User interface, accessible via desktop or mobile.  
- **Cloud**: Cloud services for hosting and scalability (examples: Oracle Cloud, Vercel, Railway).  
- **Deploy**: Publishing the application to the internet.  

## 👣 2. Application Stages

Applications can have different stages, from local development to cloud deployment and user access.

## 🦊 3. CI / CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:  
  A development practice where code changes are integrated and tested automatically several times a day. It helps to quickly identify and fix issues.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:  
  A stage where the software is continuously tested, prepared for release, and can be deployed at any time.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:  
  Automatic deployment of software to production after passing all testing stages.

## 📦 4. Repository

A place where the application's source code is stored and managed.

- **Monorepo**: A repository that contains multiple projects, usually with back-end and front-end in the same structure, making collaboration easier.  
- **Multirepo**: Separate repositories for different parts of the application (e.g., back-end and front-end in distinct repositories).

## 🗂️ 5. Types of Applications

- **CRUD Applications (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**:  
  Basic applications that allow creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

- **Microservices**:  
  Architecture where the application is divided into small, independent, and modular services, each with its own logic and database.

- **Monolithic**:  
  Application where all functionalities (back-end and front-end) are in a single codebase.

## 🧮 6. Frameworks and Libraries

- **Libraries**:  
  A collection of tools and functions you can use to perform specific tasks (e.g., JQuery, React). You control when and how to use the library.

- **Frameworks**:  
  A more complete structure with rules and conventions that serves as a base to organize and develop your application (e.g., Spring Boot, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, .NET ASP.NET).

## 📚 7. Recommended Books

The mind map shows book covers with themes such as **"Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript"** and **"APIs"**.
